# DesignDocument
Design Document for a college level Java course

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wanted to build a multi-platform game that was availible to run on PC and mobile platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In this document I outlined developement needs and the best plan of action for the client to take based on what needs had to be met.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I like thinking about what is needed before I start making a program, it helps me have a base layer to build off of that makes the coding easier.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to eventually use more buzzwords to sound more professional.
